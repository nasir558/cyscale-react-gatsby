### Dear friend, get ready to secure your apps & data in a multi-cloud world.

#### The era of remote work and cloud computing is here, and we're excited to share that you can experience enhanced cloud security right from your Cyscale account. This includes:

* Multi-tenancy support for a Corporate Account and associated Users.
* Single auto-onboarding step for multiple Azure Subscriptions under a Tenant.
* [Microsoft Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/cyscale.power-cloud-saas-basic) listing of the Cyscale Power Cloud Platform.
* Signup & access the Cyscale account using Microsoft, Google, or GitHub social logins.
* Notifications to *Slack*, *Teams*, *Datadog,* and *Email*. Whenever your security policies are violated, you're instantly notified. You can also manually send an alert later.
* Simplified onboarding for AWS and GCP using CloudFormation and Terraform.
* Use API Keys to speed up integrations with CI/CD and other developer tools.
